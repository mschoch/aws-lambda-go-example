My name is <a href="https://github.com/mschoch/">Marty Schoch</a>, and this is Bluge Labs.

Bluge Labs is an experiment in funding open-source development and maintenance.  Back in 2014 when work first began on <a href="https://github.com/blevesearch/bleve/">Bleve</a> at <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/">Couchbase</a> we were determined to create a true open-source community around the project.  Everyone involved is extremely proud of how the project grew and matured over time.

However, there are limitations of this model when most of the contributions are coming from a single employer.  In 2018 I had the opportunity to work closely with other development teams, and see the unique way in which they were using Bleve.  With this new perspective, I've been working to construct a new model. In this new model, the companies which rely on Bleve can come together and share the costs and benefits of this investment.
